# python-challenge

In one part of the challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 


My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


- The total number of months included in the dataset


- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In the second part of the challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.


I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


- The total number of votes cast


- A complete list of candidates who received votes


- The percentage of votes each candidate won


- The total number of votes each candidate won


- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
